# SMART-VOLUME-CONTROLLER-USING-HAND-GESTURES-AND-OPENCV-PYTHON
Developed a **gesture-based volume control system** using **Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw** to enable touchless audio control. The system tracks **hand movements in real-time**, detects the distance between the thumb and index finger, and adjusts system volume accordingly.
